# Critical Launch Fixes - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Prompt Buddy Container Not Disappearing When Toggle is Off**
**Problem**: The panel remained visible even when the toggle was turned off
**Root Cause**: The `updateToggleState` function only changed toggle appearance but didn't control panel visibility
**Solution**: 
- Updated `updateToggleState` function to show/hide the panel based on toggle state
- Added panel visibility control in `loadInitialToggleState` for proper initial state
- Panel now properly disappears when toggle is turned off

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In updateToggleState function
if (isEnabled) {
  // Show the panel
  if (panel) {
    panel.style.display = 'block';
  }
} else {
  // Hide the panel
  if (panel) {
    panel.style.display = 'none';
  }
}
```

### 2. âœ… **Logo Inconsistency in Extension Store**
**Problem**: Extension was using "angry face" logo as default instead of "happy face" logo
**Root Cause**: Manifest.json was set to use `inactivelogo.png` as default icons
**Solution**:
- Updated manifest.json to use `activelogo.png` (happy face) as default icons
- Modified background.js initialization to properly check stored state on startup
- Extension now shows happy face logo by default and switches to angry face when disabled

**Code Changes**:
```json
// In manifest.json
"icons": {
  "16": "activelogo.png",
  "48": "activelogo.png", 
  "128": "activelogo.png"
}
```
