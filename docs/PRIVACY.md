# Privacy Policy for Prompt Buddy

**Effective Date: December 2024**

## Overview

Prompt Buddy ("the Extension") is a free Chrome extension that helps users optimize their prompts for AI tools using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model.

**Your privacy is our top priority.** This policy provides complete transparency about our data practices and confirms that we collect ZERO personal information. We believe privacy should be the default, not an option.

## Information We Collect

All processing occurs locally in your browser, except for prompt optimization requests, which are securely sent to the OpenAI API.

- Personal information (names, emails, addresses)
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Browser history or browsing patterns
- Device information
- Location data
- Any other identifying information

### What We Store Locally (Your Device Only):
- **API Configuration**: Your OpenAI API endpoint and key (encrypted)
- **Extension Settings**: Toggle state (on/off)
- **User Feedback**: Optional feedback you submit (encrypted, stored locally)
- **Cache**: Temporary prompt optimization results (5-minute expiry)

### Security Architecture
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only necessary Chrome permissions requested
