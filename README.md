# ⚡ Prompt Buddy

**Lightning-fast AI prompt engineering in 2-3 seconds. One toggle. One button. Zero drama.**

🎨⚡ **NEW**: Now with custom logos, AES-256 encryption, dynamic icons, and bulletproof error handling!

## Design Philosophy

"Plain talk in. Engineer-grade prompts out. Lightning fast."

Prompt Buddy delivers exactly that:
- **⚡ Lightning Speed**: 2-3 second responses (down from 13+ seconds!)
- **🧠 AI Intelligence**: GPT-4o-mini powered prompt engineering
- **🎯 One Toggle**: Enable/disable with beautiful glassmorphism panel
- **🚀 Smart Caching**: Instant results for similar prompts (5min cache)
- **🔐 Military-Grade Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption for API keys
- **🎨 Dynamic Icons**: Visual feedback with active/inactive states
- **✨ Zero Drama**: Clean, professional interface that just works

## How It Works

1. **Install** the extension
2. **Configure** your API endpoint and key
3. **Toggle ON** the beautiful floating panel on ChatGPT
4. **Type any prompt** and click "⚡ Engineer Prompt"
5. **Watch** as Prompt Buddy auto-engineers it before sending

When the toggle is ON, Prompt Buddy intercepts every prompt on ChatGPT, sends it to your API, and replaces it with the optimized/debugged/analyzed version. GPT-4o decides what your prompt needs.

## Supported Platforms

- **ChatGPT**: chat.openai.com, chatgpt.com
- **Future**: Cursor web support planned

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`

## API Integration

The extension uses OpenAI's GPT-4o with this system prompt:

> "You are Prompt Buddy, an expert prompt engineer, code debugger, and analyst. When a user sends a prompt, intelligently determine if it is a bug report, a feature request, or a prompt to optimize. Reply with an improved, more technical version of the prompt if optimization is needed, a step-by-step debugging guide if a bug, or an engineering-level analysis if a feature. Start each response with one of: [OPTIMIZED], [DEBUG], or [ANALYSIS]."

## Privacy & Security

- **🔐 AES-256-GCM Encryption**: All API keys and endpoints encrypted before storage
